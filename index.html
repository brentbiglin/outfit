		<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding Process</h3>
      <p>The onboarding process introduces the primary feature immediately upon sign-up: making a fit profile so that all the clothes have at least a 70% likelihood of fitting perfectly. This information is based on collaborative filtering of user's self-reported clothing items that fit. Then we introduce the concept of liking (which contribues to the collaborative filtering) and saving items of interest that can be found easily later and for which sales and discounts can be advertised. The closet is an inventory of all clothing that the user owns and has logged. Users can, of course, purchase clothing through the application.</p>
      <p>After creating an account, users are shown ten sets of clothing that contribute to their style profiles and determine which gendered clothing they prefer, if any. It also allows for people who do not identify with a binary gender classification to choose male- and female-gendered clothing. The second step of the fit profile is selecting brands and sizes of different clothing items that users would typically wear. After providing height and weight, users have the option of entering their measurements, if they know them, or indicating their body shape using scalar and visual measurements. We ask users to indicate three specific items of clothing that fit them really well, and then request access to their email account to compile past purchases and/or to add clothing items individually.</p> 
		<h3 id="home">Home Page</h3>
      <p>The home page is actually an algorithmically generated never-ending list of clothing items that are presented on cards. Users can like, add to wishlist, or purchase the items from card icons. If they tap the card, they are taken to the item's page in which they can find user-generated ratings and reviews.
      <p>Daily Recommendation notifications can alert users to general sales and discounts.</p>
		<h3 id="purchase">Purchase</h3>
      <p>When a user chooses to purchase an item, they add it to the cart with the "arrow down cart" within the card. After adding the item to the cart, they have the option of checking out. They can also tap the cart icon at the top right of every screen. Users can make the usual adjustments of quantity and size, as well as the option of choosing a retailer when there is more than one option available. All items are purchased in-app and users are not redirected to 3rd party and retailer sites.</p>
		<h3 id="browse">Browse</h3>
      <p>The Browse section groups clothing into different categories based on style, occasion, and season. Clicking into the category allows the user to browse various clothing items (pants, shirts, et cetera) that fall within the category. They can click an item's card and see the item page just as they can on the home page to see the item's ratings and reviews.</p>
		<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
      <p>Users can perform a simple search from almost any page of the application and it will drop them off in the browse section along with their results. However, they can also use a number of filtering options for item type, brand, size, color, season, and price. When the users are browsing filtered search results, the filter icon is a noticeable blue to indicate that filters are in effect so that they can modify a search without starting over completely. From the search results, users can tap the item's card to view the item page just as they can in Home and Browse.</p>
		<h3>Closet</h3>
		<p>The Closet is where a user can view outfit recommendations based on clothing that they already own based on weather and calendar events, view their clothing items, and create their own outfit combinations to save for later use. Choosing Outfit Recommendations shows a calendar view in which outfits have been placed for recommendations based on keywords in users' calendar events, such as weddings or parties. These recommendations take into account the weather as well to provide appropriate outfits. Users can set outfits for particular days and schedules as well. WHAT DOES THE SHUFFLE BUTTON DO HERE?</p>
      <p>My Items shows a grid of the user's items, to which they can add clothing through the camera or photo gallery application. My Outfits showwwwwwwwwww zzzzzzz</p>
