		<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding Process</h3>
      <p>The onboarding process introduces the primary feature immediately upon sign-up: making a fit profile so that all the clothes have at least a 70% likelihood of fitting perfectly. This information is based on collaborative filtering of user's self-reported clothing items that fit. Then we introduce the concept of liking (which contribues to the collaborative filtering) and saving items of interest that can be found easily later and for which sales and discounts can be advertised. The closet is an inventory of all clothing that the user owns and has logged. Users can, of course, purchase clothing through the application.</p>
      <p>After creating an account, users are shown ten sets of clothing that contribute to their style profiles and determine which gendered clothing they prefer, if any. It also allows for people who do not identify with a binary gender classification to choose male- and female-gendered clothing. The second step of the fit profile is selecting brands and sizes of different clothing items that users would typically wear. After providing height and weight, users have the option of entering their measurements, if they know them, or indicating their body shape using scalar and visual measurements. We ask users to indicate three specific items of clothing that fit them really well, and then request access to their email account to compile past purchases and/or to add clothing items individually.</p> 
		<h3 id="home">Home Page</h3>
      <p>The home page is actually an algorithmically generated never-ending list of clothing items that are presented on cards. Users can like, add to wishlist, or purchase the items from card icons. If they tap the card, they are taken to the item's page in which they can find user-generated ratings and reviews.

		<p>The accompanying mechanic of the game that fuels the bud ecosystem is the process by which you earn waterdrops: by completing and logging environmental activities and habits. There are multiple ways of doing this, but all take place in the <strong>Log Activity</strong> section, which is accessed by tapping the drop and plus sign at the bottom right of the home screen. Once in that section, the first method to log an activity is by tapping the plus button and searching for the activity. All of the activities that match the query will appear and you're able to mark the activity as completed from there. If the activity is not already on the app, you can manually add an activity. These activites can serve as crowdsourced activities to add in the future.</p>
		<p>The second way of adding an activity is by one of four categories: <strong>Waste Reduction</strong>, <strong>Nature & Community</strong>, <strong>Saving Energy</strong>, and <strong>Conscious Eating</strong>. Tapping the category leads you to a submenu of all the relevant activites. From there, you can log the activity.</p>
		<p>The last way to add an activity is through the two quick menus. <strong>Recent</strong> shows most recently logged activites and <strong>Favorites</strong> shows activites that have been tagged with the heart icon filled in at the top left of the activity's box. If an activity has already been logged for the day, the drop icon is filled in and you are unable to log that activity for drops for the day. These more nuanced states of activites are not interactive in the prototype, but you can tap an activity that has already been logged for the day to see the alert, "You already completed this activity today."</p>
		<p>Finally, you are able to gain bonus drops by completing <strong>Drop Challenges</strong>, like completing a given activity every day for a week or a month. Through the <strong>Discover</strong> section, you can sign up for particular challenges after reading an article about it, such as eating vegetarian on a particular day or days in a row.</p>

		<h3>Closet</h3>
		<p>At the top right of the home screen are three menu items: <strong>Friends</strong>, <strong>Discover</strong>, and <strong>Settings</strong>. The settings page is straightforward. It shows your username and the option to log out or change your password in addition to connected social media accounts and the option to unlink them.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Friends</strong> section contains notifications for friends who have visited your garden and watered plants for you or sent you waterdrops. The <strong>Ranking</strong> section shows all of your friends in order of how many waterdrops they have accumulated by logging activities. <strong>Add Friends</strong> gives you the option of connecting your social media accounts to add or invite friends (depending on whether or not they already use the app).</p>
		<p>The <strong>Discover</strong> section is a collection of articles about environmental topics. When an article is marked as read, you can earn waterdrops. Sometimes a particular <strong>Drop Challenge</strong> will be associated with the article. If you read the article, accept the challenge, and complete it, you gain bonus drops in addition to the amount of drops you would gain from logging the activity outside of a challenge.</p>
